# You Don't Know JS Yet: Objects & Classes - 2nd Edition
# Foreword

Kyle Simpson has an unmatched brilliance in the art of explanation.

In April of 2015 I was honored to author the foreword for Kyle's book [You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/you-dont-know/9781491905241/), an exciting and detailed deep-dive into new JavaScript language features that hadn't even yet been ratified by Ecma (that wouldn't happen until June 2015), but had already made their way out into the world. At the time, there was gap in meaningful documentation and educational resources, and I declared that no better person had stepped up to fill it. I stand by everything I wrote in 2015, and I'm here in 2022 to double down for [You Don't Know JS Yet: Objects & Classes]().

We are all better off for the time, effort and resources that Kyle pours into forming a better understanding of the JavaScript programming language for himself, and for the betterment of his peers: learning, honing and distilling complex semantics into easily digestable concepts that can be built upon in infinite, myriad ways. And that's exactly what we witness here: Kyle becomes an expert in programming subject matter by consuming it at every level. By probing the semantics of new language features, luring them out from the shadows, releasing them from arcane origins and freeing them for our consumption and growth.

Even as a successful professional software engineer, I keep Kyle's works close at hand. At times these tomes are helpful in explaining deeply complex concepts to teammates and peers, while other times they serve as refreshers for myself, because there's always some interesting take-away or new perspective to gain.
