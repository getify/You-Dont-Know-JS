Foreign translations are appreciated. However, any such requests should wait until the 2nd edition is complete.

**I will not be accepting any new foreign translations for previous editions.**

To summarize, the steps for a foreign language translation are:

1. Fork this repo
2. Make your own translation entirely in your fork, preferably of all six books, but at a minimum of one whole book
3. File an issue asking for a branch to be made on our main repo, named for that [language's ISO code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)
4. Once the branch is created, you can PR to merge your translated work in
5. Once the merge is complete, I will promote you to a repository maintainer so you can manage any further translation maintenance work on your own branch of this repo
