# You Don't Know JS Yet: Scope & Closures - 2nd Edition
# Chapter 1: What is Scope?

| Work in progress |

One key foundation of programming languages is storing values in variables and retrieving those values later. In fact, this process is the primary way we model program *state*. A program without *state* is a pretty uninteresting program, so this topic is at the very heart of what it means to write programs.

But to understand how variables work, we should first ask: where do variables *live*? In other words, how are your program's variables organized and accessed by the JS engine?

These questions imply the need for a well-defined set of rules for managing variables, called *scope*. This chapter will illustrate *scope* by listening in on "conversations" inside the JS engine as it processes and executes our programs.

## About This Book

If you already finished *Get Started* (the first book of this series), you're in the right spot! If not, before you proceed I encourage you to *start there* for the best foundation.

Our focus in this second book is the first pillar (of three!) in the JS language: the scope system and its function closures, and how these mechanisms enable the module design pattern.

JS is typically classified as an interpreted scripting language, so it's assumed that programs are processed in a single, top-down pass. But JS is in fact parsed/compiled in a separate phase **before execution begins**. The code author's decisions on where to place variables, functions, and blocks with respect to each other are analyzed according to the rules of scope, during the initial parsing/compilation phase. The resulting scope is unaffected by run-time conditions.

JS functions are themselves values, meaning they can be assigned and passed around just like numbers or strings. But since these functions hold and access variables, they maintain their original scope no matter where in the program the functions are eventually executed. This is called closure.

Modules are a pattern for code organization characterized by a collection of public methods that have access (via closure) to variables and functions that are hidden inside the internal scope of the module.

## Brief Intro To Code Compilation

Depending on your level of experience with various languages, you may be surprised to learn that JS is compiled, even though it's typically labeled as "dynamic" or "interpreted". JS is *not* typically compiled well in advance, as are many traditionally-compiled languages, nor are the results of compilation portable among various distributed JS engines. Nevertheless, the JS engine essentially performs the same steps as any other traditional language compiler.

A program is processed by a compiler in generally three stages:

1. **Tokenizing/Lexing:** breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens. For instance, consider the program: `var a = 2;`. This program would likely be broken up into the following tokens: `var`, `a`, `=`, `2`, and `;`. Whitespace may or may not be persisted as a token, depending on whether it's meaningful or not.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| The difference between tokenizing and lexing is subtle and academic, but it centers on whether or not these tokens are identified in a *stateless* or *stateful* way. Put simply, if the tokenizer were to invoke stateful parsing rules to figure out whether `a` should be considered a distinct token or just part of another token, *that* would be **lexing**. |

2. **Parsing:** taking a stream (array) of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represent the grammatical structure of the program. This tree is called an "AST" (<b>A</b>bstract <b>S</b>yntax <b>T</b>ree).

    For example, the tree for `var a = 2;` might start with a top-level node called `VariableDeclaration`, with a child node called `Identifier` (whose value is `a`), and another child called `AssignmentExpression` which itself has a child called `NumericLiteral` (whose value is `2`).

3. **Code Generation:** taking an AST and turning it into executable code. This part varies greatly depending on the language, the platform it's targeting, etc.

    The JS engine takes our above described AST for `var a = 2;` and turns it into a set of machine instructions to actually *create* a variable called `a` (including reserving memory, etc.), and then store a value into `a`.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| The implementation details of a JS engine (utilizing system memory resources, etc) is much deeper than we will dig here. We'll keep our focus on the observable behavior of our programs and let the JS engine manage those system abstractions. |

The JS engine is vastly more complex than *just* those three stages. In the process of parsing and code-generation, there are steps to optimize the performance of the execution, including collapsing redundant elements, etc. In fact, code can even be re-compiled and re-optimized during the progression of execution.

So, I'm painting only with broad strokes here. But you'll see shortly why *these* details we *do* cover, even at a high level, are relevant.

JS engines don't have the luxury of plenty of time to optimize, because JS compilation doesn't happen in a build step ahead of time, as with other languages. It usually must happen in mere microseconds (or less!) right before the code is executed. To ensure the fastest performance under these constraints, JS engines use all kinds of tricks (like JITs, which lazy compile and even hot re-compile, etc.) which are well beyond the "scope" of our discussion here.

Let's just say, for simplicity's sake, a JS program is processed in (at least) two phases: parsing/compilation first, then execution.

## Understanding Scope

In the next chapter, we'll dive into the nuts and bolts of scope and how it plays out in code. But first, I want us to take the time to understand scope from a conceptual perspective.

### Buckets of Marbles

One metaphor I've found effective in understanding scope is sorting colored marbles into buckets of their matching color.

Imagine you come across a pile of marbles, and notice that all the marbles are colored red, blue, or green. To sort all the marbles, let's drop the red ones into a red bucket, green into a green bucket, and blue into a blue bucket. After sorting, when you later need a green marble, you already know the green bucket is where to go to get it.

In this metaphor, the marbles are the variables in our program. The buckets are scopes (functions and blocks), which we just conceptually assign individual colors for our discussion purposes. The color of each marble is thus determined by which *color* scope we find the marble originally created in.

Consider:

```js
// outer/global scope: RED

var students = [
    { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
    { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
    { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
    { id: 6, name: "Sarah" }
];

function getStudentName(studentID) {
    // function scope: BLUE

    for (let student of students) {
        // loop scope: GREEN

        if (student.id == studentID) {
            return student.name;
        }
    }
}

var nextStudent = getStudentName(73);
nextStudent;
// "Suzy"
```

As labeled by the comments above, we designate 3 scope colors: RED (outermost global scope), BLUE (scope of function `getStudentName(..)`), and GREEN (scope of/inside the `for` loop).

The RED marbles are variables/identifiers originally declared in the RED scope:

* `students`

* `getStudentName`

* `nextStudent`

The only BLUE marble, the function parameter declared in the BLUE scope:

* `studentID`

The only GREEN marble, the loop iterator declared in the GREEN scope:

* `student`

As the JS engine processes a program (during compilation), and finds a declaration for a variable/identifier, it essentially asks, "which *color* scope am I currently in?" The variable/identifier is designated as that same *color*, meaning it belongs to that bucket.

The GREEN bucket is wholly nested inside of the BLUE bucket, and similarly the BLUE bucket is wholly nested inside the RED bucket. Scopes can nest inside each other as shown, to any depth of nesting as your program needs. But scopes can never cross boundaries, meaning no scope is ever partially in two parent scopes.

References (non-declarations) to variables/identifiers can be made from either the current scope, or any scope above/outside the current scope, but never to lower/nested scopes. So an expression in the RED bucket only has access to RED marbles, not BLUE or GREEN. An expression in the BLUE bucket can reference either BLUE or RED marbles, not GREEN. And an expression in the GREEN bucket has access to RED, BLUE, and GREEN marbles.

We can conceptualize the process of determining these marble colors during runtime as a lookup. At first, the `students` variable reference in the `for` loop-statement has no color, so we ask the current scope if it has a marble matching that name. Since it doesn't, the lookup continues with the next outer/containing scope, and so on. When the RED bucket is reached, a marble of the name `students` is found, so the loop-statement's `students` variable is determined to be a red marble.

The `if (student.id == studentID)` is similarly determined to reference a GREEN marble named `student` and a BLUE marble `studentID`.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| The JS engine doesn't generally determine these marble colors during run-time; the "lookup" here is a rhetorical device to help you understand the concepts. During compilation, most or all variable references will be from already-known scope buckets, so their color is determined at that, and stored with each marble reference to avoid unnecessary lookups as the program runs. |

The key take-aways from the marbles & buckets metaphor:

* Variables are declared in certain scopes, which can be thought of as colored marbles in matching-color buckets.

* Any reference to a variable of that same name in that scope, or any deeper nested scope, will be a marble of that same color.

* The determination of buckets, colors, and marbles is all done during compilation. This information is used during code execution.

### A Conversation Among Friends

Another useful metaphor for the process of analyzing variables and the scopes they come from is to imagine various conversations that go on inside the engine as code is processed and then executed. We can "listen in" on these conversations to get a better conceptual foundation for how scopes work.

## Understanding Scope

The way we will approach learning about scope is to think of the process in terms of a conversation. But, *who* is having the conversation?

### The Cast

Let's meet the cast of characters that interact to process the program `var a = 2;`, so we understand their conversations that we'll listen in on shortly:

1. *Engine*: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

2. *Compiler*: one of *Engine*'s friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

3. *Scope*: another friend of *Engine*; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

For you to *fully understand* how JavaScript works, you need to begin to *think* like *Engine* (and friends) think, ask the questions they ask, and answer those questions the same.

### Back & Forth

When you see the program `var a = 2;`, you most likely think of that as one statement. But that's not how our new friend *Engine* sees it. In fact, *Engine* sees two distinct statements, one which *Compiler* will handle during compilation, and one which *Engine* will handle during execution.

So, let's break down how *Engine* and friends will approach the program `var a = 2;`.

The first thing *Compiler* will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree. But when *Compiler* gets to code-generation, it will treat this program somewhat differently than perhaps assumed.

A reasonable assumption would be that *Compiler* will produce code that could be summed up by this pseudo-code: "Allocate memory for a variable, label it `a`, then stick the value `2` into that variable." Unfortunately, that's not quite accurate.

*Compiler* will instead proceed as:

1. Encountering `var a`, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to see if a variable `a` already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, *Compiler* ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to declare a new variable called `a` for that scope collection.

2. *Compiler* then produces code for *Engine* to later execute, to handle the `a = 2` assignment. The code *Engine* runs will first ask *Scope* if there is a variable called `a` accessible in the current scope collection. If so, *Engine* uses that variable. If not, *Engine* looks *elsewhere* (see nested *Scope* section below).

If *Engine* eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value `2` to it. If not, *Engine* will raise its hand and yell out an error!

To summarize: two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, *Compiler* declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, *Engine* looks up the variable in *Scope* and assigns to it, if found.

### Compiler Speak

We need a little bit more compiler terminology to proceed further with understanding.

When *Engine* executes the code that *Compiler* produced for step (2), it has to look-up the variable `a` to see if it has been declared, and this look-up is consulting *Scope*. But the type of look-up *Engine* performs affects the outcome of the look-up.

In our case, it is said that *Engine* would be performing an "LHS" look-up for the variable `a`. The other type of look-up is called "RHS".

I bet you can guess what the "L" and "R" mean. These terms stand for "Left-hand Side" and "Right-hand Side".

Side... of what? **Of an assignment operation.**

In other words, an LHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the left-hand side of an assignment operation, and an RHS look-up is done when a variable appears on the right-hand side of an assignment operation.

Actually, let's be a little more precise. An RHS look-up is indistinguishable, for our purposes, from simply a look-up of the value of some variable, whereas the LHS look-up is trying to find the variable container itself, so that it can assign. In this way, RHS doesn't *really* mean "right-hand side of an assignment" per se, it just, more accurately, means "not left-hand side".

Being slightly glib for a moment, you could also think "RHS" instead means "retrieve his/her source (value)", implying that RHS means "go get the value of...".

Let's dig into that deeper.

When I say:

```js
console.log( a );
```

The reference to `a` is an RHS reference, because nothing is being assigned to `a` here. Instead, we're looking-up to retrieve the value of `a`, so that the value can be passed to `console.log(..)`.

By contrast:

```js
a = 2;
```

The reference to `a` here is an LHS reference, because we don't actually care what the current value is, we simply want to find the variable as a target for the `= 2` assignment operation.

**Note:** LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the `=` assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".

Consider this program, which has both LHS and RHS references:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

The last line that invokes `foo(..)` as a function call requires an RHS reference to `foo`, meaning, "go look-up the value of `foo`, and give it to me." Moreover, `(..)` means the value of `foo` should be executed, so it'd better actually be a function!

There's a subtle but important assignment here. **Did you spot it?**

You may have missed the implied `a = 2` in this code snippet. It happens when the value `2` is passed as an argument to the `foo(..)` function, in which case the `2` value is **assigned** to the parameter `a`. To (implicitly) assign to parameter `a`, an LHS look-up is performed.

There's also an RHS reference for the value of `a`, and that resulting value is passed to `console.log(..)`. `console.log(..)` needs a reference to execute. It's an RHS look-up for the `console` object, then a property-resolution occurs to see if it has a method called `log`.

Finally, we can conceptualize that there's an LHS/RHS exchange of passing the value `2` (by way of variable `a`'s RHS look-up) into `log(..)`. Inside of the native implementation of `log(..)`, we can assume it has parameters, the first of which (perhaps called `arg1`) has an LHS reference look-up, before assigning `2` to it.

**Note:** You might be tempted to conceptualize the function declaration `function foo(a) {...` as a normal variable declaration and assignment, such as `var foo` and `foo = function(a){...`. In so doing, it would be tempting to think of this function declaration as involving an LHS look-up.

However, the subtle but important difference is that *Compiler* handles both the declaration and the value definition during code-generation, such that when *Engine* is executing code, there's no processing necessary to "assign" a function value to `foo`. Thus, it's not really appropriate to think of a function declaration as an LHS look-up assignment in the way we're discussing them here.

### Engine/Scope Conversation

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

Let's imagine the above exchange (which processes this code snippet) as a conversation. The conversation would go a little something like this:

> ***Engine***: Hey *Scope*, I have an RHS reference for `foo`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing `foo`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, I've got an LHS reference for `a`, ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: Why yes, I have. *Compiler* declared it as a formal parameter to `foo` just recently. Here you go.

> ***Engine***: Helpful as always, *Scope*. Thanks again. Now, time to assign `2` to `a`.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope*, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for `console`. Ever heard of it?

> ***Scope***: No problem, *Engine*, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got `console`. He's built-in. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Perfect. Looking up `log(..)`. OK, great, it's a function.

> ***Engine***: Yo, *Scope*. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to `a`. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.

> ***Scope***: You're right, *Engine*. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.

> ***Engine***: Cool. Passing the value of `a`, which is `2`, into `log(..)`.

> ...

### Quiz

Check your understanding so far. Make sure to play the part of *Engine* and have a "conversation" with the *Scope*:

```js
function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );
```

1. Identify all the LHS look-ups (there are 3!).

2. Identify all the RHS look-ups (there are 4!).

**Note:** See the chapter review for the quiz answers!

## Nested Scope

We said that *Scope* is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name. There's usually more than one *Scope* to consider, however.

Just as a block or function is nested inside another block or function, scopes are nested inside other scopes. So, if a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, *Engine* consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until found or until the outermost (aka, global) scope has been reached.

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( 2 ); // 4
```

The RHS reference for `b` cannot be resolved inside the function `foo`, but it can be resolved in the *Scope* surrounding it (in this case, the global).

So, revisiting the conversations between *Engine* and *Scope*, we'd overhear:

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* of `foo`, ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Nope, never heard of it. Go fish."

> ***Engine***: "Hey, *Scope* outside of `foo`, oh you're the global *Scope*, ok cool. Ever heard of `b`? Got an RHS reference for it."

> ***Scope***: "Yep, sure have. Here ya go."

The simple rules for traversing nested *Scope*: *Engine* starts at the currently executing *Scope*, looks for the variable there, then if not found, keeps going up one level, and so on. If the outermost global scope is reached, the search stops, whether it finds the variable or not.

### Building on Metaphors

To visualize the process of nested *Scope* resolution, I want you to think of this tall building.

<img src="fig1.png" width="250">

The building represents our program's nested *Scope* rule set. The first floor of the building represents your currently executing *Scope*, wherever you are. The top level of the building is the global *Scope*.

You resolve LHS and RHS references by looking on your current floor, and if you don't find it, taking the elevator to the next floor, looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global *Scope*), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless.

## Errors

Why does it matter whether we call it LHS or RHS?

Because these two types of look-ups behave differently in the circumstance where the variable has not yet been declared (is not found in any consulted *Scope*).

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
	b = a;
}

foo( 2 );
```

When the RHS look-up occurs for `b` the first time, it will not be found. This is said to be an "undeclared" variable, because it is not found in the scope.

If an RHS look-up fails to ever find a variable, anywhere in the nested *Scope*s, this results in a `ReferenceError` being thrown by the *Engine*. It's important to note that the error is of the type `ReferenceError`.

By contrast, if the *Engine* is performing an LHS look-up and arrives at the top floor (global *Scope*) without finding it, and if the program is not running in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], then the global *Scope* will create a new variable of that name **in the global scope**, and hand it back to *Engine*.

*"No, there wasn't one before, but I was helpful and created one for you."*

"Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], which was added in ES5, has a number of different behaviors from normal/relaxed/lazy mode. One such behavior is that it disallows the automatic/implicit global variable creation. In that case, there would be no global *Scope*'d variable to hand back from an LHS look-up, and *Engine* would throw a `ReferenceError` similarly to the RHS case.

Now, if a variable is found for an RHS look-up, but you try to do something with its value that is impossible, such as trying to execute-as-function a non-function value, or reference a property on a `null` or `undefined` value, then *Engine* throws a different kind of error, called a `TypeError`.

`ReferenceError` is *Scope* resolution-failure related, whereas `TypeError` implies that *Scope* resolution was successful, but that there was an illegal/impossible action attempted against the result.

## Review (TL;DR)

Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.

LHS references result from assignment operations. *Scope*-related assignments can occur either with the `=` operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.

The JavaScript *Engine* first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like `var a = 2;` into two separate steps:

1. First, `var a` to declare it in that *Scope*. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.

2. Later, `a = 2` to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing *Scope*, and if need be (that is, they don't find what they're looking for there), they work their way up the nested *Scope*, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don't.

Unfulfilled RHS references result in `ReferenceError`s being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a `ReferenceError` (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).
