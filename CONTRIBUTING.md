# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book, as I (and my publisher) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but I just wanted to be extra clear on that.

## Reading Experience (Chapter/Section links, etc)

I understand that reading one long .md file, with no relative cross links to other sections/etc, is not the preferred reading experience for most of you. As such, it's totally reasonable to want to file an issue/PR to add those kinds of features.

This topic has been brought up many times, and I've considered it. For now, I **do not** accept these kinds of changes into the repo.

The main purpose of my book repos is to track and manage the content for the purposes of publication (paid-for ebooks and print books). I do this in the open because I also care about providing free and early access to the content, to make sure there is no paywall barrier to learning.

As such, this repo **is not optimized for your reading experience.**

The intended **best reading experience** are the published books (either ebook or print), so I encourage you to purchase them for that purpose.

## Editions

The current edition (*work in progress*) of the books is the 2nd edition. While these 2nd edition books are in progress, feel free to provide any contributions.

I **am not accepting any contributions** for previous edition books.

## Typos?

Please don't worry about minor text typos. These will almost certainly be caught during the editing process.

If you're going to submit a PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits). Or, **just don't even worry about them for now,** because we'll get to them later. I promise.

## Search First!

Also, if you have any questions or concerns, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first, to keep the churn of issues to a minimum. I want to keep my focus on writing these books as much as possible.
