# You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond
# Chapter 4: Async Flow Control

It's no secret if you've written any significant amount of JavaScript that asynchronous programming is a required skill. The primary mechanism for managing asynchrony has been the function callback.

However, ES6 adds a new feature which helps address significant shortcomings in the callbacks-only approach to async: *Promises*. In addition, we can revisit generators (from the previous chapter) and see a pattern for combining the two that's a major step forward in async flow control programming in JavaScript.

**Note:** This chapter will only briefly overview Promises, as they are covered in-depth in the *Async & Performance* title of this series.
