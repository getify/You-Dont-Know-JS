# You Don't Know JS Yet: Types & Grammar - 2nd Edition
# Chapter 3: Object Values

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Work in progress |

Now that we're comfortable with the built-in primitive types, we turn our attention to the `object` types in JS.

The "Objects & Classes" title of this series covers objects in-depth already, so make sure you've read that before continuning with this chapter. Here we'll focus our attention on how the `object` value-type behaves and interacts with other values in JS.

## Nature Of Objects

The `object` value-type comprises several sub-types with specialized behaviors. These include:

* general objects
* fundamental objects (boxed primitives)
* arrays
* regular expressions
* functions (aka, "callable objects")

But one shared characteristic is that all objects are capable of acting as collections of values.

## Fundamental Objects

In Chapter 2, I briefly mentioned *auto-boxing*, which we'll now revisit. [^AutoBoxing]
